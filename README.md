# GraphsAlgorithmsRCP105
Simple Python project to run and tests some graphs algorithms

All the following functions are running in main.py :
- `import_matrix()` to import adjacency matrixes written in .txt files
- `generate_graph()` to generate a random adjacency matrix
- `is_related()` to verify if a graph is related
- `chain_in_graph()` to verify if a chain belongs to a graph
- `elementary_chain()` to reduce a chain 
- `isthmus_list()` to get the list of isthmus of a graph
- `is_an_isthmus()` to know if the relationship between two given nodes are part of an isthmus
